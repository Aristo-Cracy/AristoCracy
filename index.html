      and other important information that will help you understand how our clan operates and what is expected of its
      members. Let's work together to build a strong and successful clan!
      <br>
      <br>
      #This webpage contains information about the responsibilities, duties, and expectations for and from every
      individual of the clan. It is important for each and every one to familiarize themselves with this information and
      to adhere to these guidelines in order to fulfill their roles effectively.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2 id="section1">1. Requirements</h2>
    <p>To become a member of our clan, we have the following requirements that must be met:
    <ol>
      <li>Townhall level: Currently, our minimum town hall requirement to join our clan is Town Hall 9 (TH9) or higher.
        This requirement is in place to ensure that our members have access to the troops, spells, and defenses needed
        to participate actively in clan wars, clan games, and other events.</li>
      <li>Minimum trophy count: We require a minimum trophy count of 2200 to join our clan. This ensures that our
        members are active and have experience playing the game.</li>
      <li>Donation requirements: We expect our members to donate troops to other members on a regular basis. Members
        must donate at least 1200(40 troop capacity per day) troops per season.</li>
      <li>Respectful behavior: We expect all members to treat each other with respect and refrain from any negative
        behavior or language. Discriminatory or derogatory comments will not be tolerated. </li>
      <li>Activity: We expect members to be active in the game and in the clan. Everyone is expected to have atleat 90
        attacks in every season. Members should participate in clan wars, clan games, and donate troops regularly.
        Inactive members may be subject to removal from the clan.</li>
      <li>Age requirement: We require all members to be at least 16 years old to join our clan.</li>
    </ol>

    By meeting these requirements, you will become a valued member of our clan and contribute to our success.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section2">2. Language</h2>
    <p>
      Our clan welcomes members from all over the world, and as such, we have a diverse community of players who may
      speak different languages. While English is the primary language used in the clan chat, we understand that not all
      members may be fluent in English.
      <br><br>
      We encourage all members to communicate in English as much as possible, to ensure that everyone can understand and
      participate in the conversation. However, we understand that language barriers can be a challenge, and we will
      make every effort to accommodate members who may have difficulty communicating in English.
      <br><br>
      If a member is not fluent in English, we encourage them to communicate in their native language as much as
      possible, as long as they are still able to follow our rules and guidelines. In such cases, we may rely on
      translation tools to help us communicate effectively.
      <br><br>
      We believe that diversity and inclusivity are important values for our clan, and we are committed to creating a
      welcoming and supportive environment for all members, regardless of their language or background. By working
      together and communicating effectively, we can build a strong and active community that supports each other and
      achieves our common goals.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section3">3. Donations & Receives</h2>
    <!-- <p>Nullam porttitor turpis eu sapien tincidunt efficitur. Praesent commodo libero in lectus euismod feugiat. Aliquam erat volutpat.</p> -->

    <h3>3.1. Donations</h3>
    <p>Donations are an essential part of our clan's success, and we expect all members to participate in the donation
      system. Donating troops is a great way to help your fellow clan members and earn XP, and it also helps us win wars
      and clan games.<br><br>
      When making donations, we have a few guidelines that we ask members to follow:
    <ol>
      <li>Donate only what is requested: When a member requests troops, they will specify which troops they need. Please
        donate only the troops that are requested, as this ensures that members receive the troops they need for their
        attacks.</li>
      <li>Donate high-level troops: Whenever possible, please donate high-level troops that are useful in war attacks.
        This includes troops such as eds, super dragons, dragons, hounds, witches, wizards, super minions, etc. </li>
      <li>Don't be a hog: While it's great to receive donations, please don't be greedy when requesting troops. Be
        considerate of other members and only request what you need for your attacks. </li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>3.2. Receives</h3>
    <p>In addition to making donations, all members will also receive troops from other members. When receiving troops,
      we ask that members do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>Thank the donor: When you receive troops, take a moment to thank the member who donated them. This helps build
        camaraderie within the clan and encourages members to continue donating. </li>
      <li>Use the troops wisely: Use the troops you receive in war attacks or for farming, and don't waste them on
        unnecessary battles. </li>
    </ol>
    By following these guidelines for donations and receives, we can ensure that our clan remains strong and successful.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="section4">4. Clan Wars</h2>
    <p>Clan wars are an important part of our clan's activities, and we take them seriously. They are a great way to
      test our skills and teamwork, and to earn loot and rewards for our clan.
      <br>
      <br>
      To participate in clan wars, members must opt-in by selecting the "I'm In" button in the clan war screen. Once the
      war has started, members will be matched up against an opposing clan and will have a set amount of time to make
      their attacks.
      <br>
      <br>
      Here are some guidelines for participating in clan wars:
    <ol>
      <li>Use both attacks: All members who opt-in to a war are expected to use both of their attacks. This ensures that
        we have the best chance of winning the war. </li>
      <li>Attack appropriate targets: Members should only attack bases that are appropriate for their level and skill.
        We will assign targets based on your level and strength. </li>
      <li>Communicate with your clanmates: Communication is key during clan wars. If you're unsure about which base to
        attack, ask for advice from your clanmates. If you're unable to make your attacks, let us know as soon as
        possible so we can adjust our strategy. </li>
      <li>Be patient: Sometimes wars don't go as planned, and we may lose battles. Don't get discouraged and keep a
        positive attitude. We'll learn from our mistakes and come back stronger in the next war. </li>
    </ol>
    We take clan wars seriously and expect all members to do their best to help the clan win. By working together and
    communicating effectively, we can achieve great things in clan wars.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section5">5. Clan Capital</h2>
    <p> Clan Capital is a special structure in Clash of Clans that can be built by clan members using resources obtained
      through raids. It provides a bonus to clan members during clan wars and can also be upgraded to increase its
      effectiveness. To ensure success during a raid weekend, clan members should prioritize attacking enemy bases,
      obtaining as many resources as possible, and contributing them to the clan to build and upgrade the Clan Capital.
    <br><br>
    Things a member should do during a raid weekend:
    <ol>
      <li>Members should be prepared and strategize their attacks by scouting enemy bases and discussing strategies with other members.</li>
      <li>Members should prioritize attacking enemy bases that are within their skill level to maximize successful attacks.</li>
      <li>Contributing resources obtained from raid attacks can help build and upgrade the Clan Capital.</li>
      <li>Members should actively communicate and coordinate with each other during the raid to maximize the collective success of the clan.</li>
    </ol>
    
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section6">6. Clan Games </h2>
    <p>Clan Games is a special event in Clash of Clans that allows clan members to work together to complete challenges
      and earn rewards. The event lasts for a set period of time and offers various tasks that require players to either
      attack other bases, collect resources or donate troops.
      <br><br>
      To participate in Clan Games, members must earn a minimum of 900 points. These points are earned by completing
      challenges, and each challenge has a set number of points associated with it.
      <br><br>
      Here are some guidelines for participating in Clan Games:
    <ol>
      <li>Work together: Clan Games require teamwork to be successful. Members should communicate with each other and
        coordinate their efforts to maximize their points.</li>
      <li>Focus on high point challenges: Some challenges offer more points than others. Members should focus on
        completing the challenges that offer the most points to maximize their score.</li>
      <li>Participate actively: To make the most of Clan Games, members should actively participate throughout the
        event. This means checking in regularly and completing challenges whenever possible.</li>
      <li>Be considerate of others: While it's important to earn points, members should also be considerate of other
        members and not hog challenges. Be sure to share challenges with other members so everyone has a chance to earn
        points.</li>
    </ol>
    By participating actively and working together as a team, we can earn enough points to reach the target and receive
    the rewards offered in Clan Games.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="section7">7. Behavior and conduct</h2>
    <p>As a clan, we value good behavior and conduct from all our members. It is important that we all treat each other
      with respect and create a positive and welcoming atmosphere for everyone in the clan. Here are some guidelines for
      behavior and conduct within the clan:
    <ol>
      <li>Be respectful: All members should treat each other with respect, regardless of differences in opinion, race,
        religion, or any other factor. Any form of discrimination, harassment, or bullying will not be tolerated.</li>
      <li>Be helpful: Members should be willing to help each other with any questions or concerns they may have. We are
        all here to support each other and make progress together.</li>
      <li>Communicate effectively: Communication is key in any team-based activity, and it is no different in Clash of
        Clans. Members should communicate effectively and clearly with each other to ensure that we are all on the same
        page.</li>
      <li>Follow the rules: We have specific rules and guidelines that are in place for the benefit of the clan. Members
        should follow these rules at all times and report any violations to the clan leader or co-leaders.</li>
      <li>Keep a positive attitude: Maintaining a positive attitude and having fun is essential for a good clan
        experience. We encourage all members to be positive and supportive of each other, even in difficult times.</li>
    </ol>
    By adhering to these guidelines, we can create a welcoming and supportive environment for all members. Remember, we
    are all here to have fun and progress together in the game, so let's work together and maintain good behavior and
    conduct at all times.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section8">8. Ban</h2>
    <p>As leaders of our clan, we understand that maintaining a positive and supportive environment is crucial to our
      success. While we value all members of our clan, there may be rare instances where we need to take strict action,
      and certain players may be permanently banned from our clan. We take this decision after careful consideration of
      all available options and only as a last resort. Some possible reasons for a permanent ban include violating our
      rules and guidelines, exhibiting disruptive behavior, or causing harm to our clan in any way. We keep a record of
      such players in a spreadsheet file, which is updated regularly and shared below. We want to assure all members
      that we take these actions to protect the clan's interests and ensure its continued success.

    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 id="section9">9. Promotion and Demotion </h2>
    <p>Promotion and demotion in the clan are important tools for maintaining a healthy and active community. As a clan,
      we want to ensure that our members are active, contributing, and working towards the common goals of the clan.
      Here are some guidelines for promotion and demotion:
    <ol>
      <li>Promotion: Promotion is based on a member's performance and contribution to the clan. Members who show
        consistent activity, participate in clan wars, donate troops, and help other members will be considered for
        promotion. The clan leader or co-leaders will evaluate each member's performance and determine if they are
        eligible for promotion.</li>
      <li>Demotion: Demotion is based on a member's inactivity or violation of clan rules. Members who are inactive for
        an extended period of time or who consistently break clan rules will be considered for demotion. The clan leader
        or co-leaders will evaluate each member's performance and determine if demotion is necessary.</li>
      <li>Communication: Communication is key when it comes to promotion and demotion. If a member has questions about
        their status or feels that they have been unfairly demoted or not promoted, they should communicate with the
        clan leader or co-leaders. We value open communication and want to ensure that everyone feels heard and
        respected.</li>
      <li>Fairness: We strive to be fair and objective when it comes to promotion and demotion. All members will be
        evaluated based on their performance and contribution to the clan, and decisions will be made based on these
        factors alone.</li>
    </ol>
    By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our clan is active, healthy, and working towards common goals.
    Let's all work together to contribute to the clan and support each other in our efforts.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section10">10. Kick</h2>
    <p>Kicking a member is never a decision that should be taken lightly, but there are certain situations where it may
      be necessary to maintain the health and activity of the clan. Here are some reasons why a member may be kicked
      from the clan:

    <ol>
      <li>Inactivity: Members who are inactive for an extended period of time may be kicked from the clan. This is
        because inactive members do not contribute to the clan's progress and can slow down our overall activity level.
      </li>
      <li>Breaking clan rules: Members who consistently break clan rules may be kicked from the clan. These rules are in
        place to ensure the health and success of the clan, and violations can harm the clan's progress and reputation.
      </li>
      <li>Leaving without Permission: If a member leaves the clan without informing our leaders, it can create confusion
        and disrupt our activities. As such, we have a policy that any member who leaves the clan without informing our
        leaders may be permanently banned from our clan. </li>
      <li>Failure to participate: Members who consistently fail to participate in clan wars, Clan Games, and other clan
        activities may be kicked from the clan. Active participation is critical to maintaining a healthy and successful
        clan.</li>
      <li>Toxic behavior: Members who engage in toxic behavior, such as bullying or discrimination, may be kicked from
        the clan. Toxic behavior can harm the morale of the clan and create a negative atmosphere.</li>
    </ol>
    It is important to note that kicking a member should be a last resort, and efforts should be made to communicate
    with the member and provide opportunities for improvement before resorting to a kick. Additionally, the decision to
    kick a member should be made by the clan leader or co-leaders, with input from other members as necessary.
    <br><br>
    By maintaining clear guidelines and communication, we can create a healthy and active clan where everyone feels
    welcome and supported.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section11">11. Limitations, Special cases, & Exceptions</h2>
    <p>While we aim to have clear guidelines and rules for the clan, there may be certain limitations, special cases,
      and exceptions that need to be considered. Here are some examples:
    <ol>
      <li>Time off: Members may need to take a break from the game for personal reasons, such as travel, family
        obligations, or health issues. In such cases, we can make exceptions to the inactivity rule and allow the member
        to take time off without being kicked from the clan.</li>
      <li>Accommodations for disabilities: Some members may have disabilities that affect their ability to participate
        in the game or meet certain requirements. In such cases, we can make accommodations to ensure that the member
        can still participate in the clan to the best of their ability.</li>
      <li>Special events: Occasionally, there may be special events or circumstances that require exceptions to our
        normal rules or guidelines. For example, during a clan war, we may need to adjust donation requirements to
        accommodate our war strategy.</li>
      <li>Language barriers: Our clan may have members who speak different languages or have different levels of fluency
        in English. In such cases, we can make accommodations to ensure that all members can communicate effectively and
        participate in clan activities.</li>
    </ol>
    It is important to handle limitations, special cases, and exceptions on a case-by-case basis, with input from the
    clan leader or co-leaders as necessary. We want to ensure that our clan is welcoming and supportive of all members,
    and that everyone has the opportunity to participate and contribute to the best of their ability.
    <br><br>
    *Players who have been in our clan for at least a month may be overlooked for inactivity or not meeting season
    requirements, provided they have a history of being an active member. This policy is not permanent, and we encourage
    all members to participate actively.

    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="section12">12. Leader & Co-leaders</h2>
    <p>As leaders and co-leaders of our clan, we have the responsibility of maintaining a fair, active, and supportive
      community for all members. We take this responsibility seriously and work hard to ensure that our clan is a
      welcoming and enjoyable place to be.
      <br><br>
      However, being a leader can come with its challenges. We may need to make difficult decisions regarding the clan's
      rules, policies, and members, and we have to deal with issues such as inactivity, donation problems, and conflicts
      between members. We do our best to handle these issues fairly and efficiently, but we understand that not all
      members may agree with our decisions.
      <br><br>
      We ask that all members respect our authority as leaders and co-leaders. We have been appointed to these positions
      because we have demonstrated our commitment to the clan and our ability to lead effectively. We make decisions
      based on what we believe is best for the clan as a whole, and we ask that members do not question our authority or
      undermine our decisions.
      <br><br>
      We are also aware that we are human, and we may make mistakes. If we do make a mistake, we will take
      responsibility for it and work to rectify the situation. We value feedback from our members and will listen to any
      concerns or suggestions that are brought to our attention.
      <br><br>
      In summary, we ask that all members of our clan respect our authority and our decisions, and understand that we
      are working hard to create a positive and enjoyable experience for everyone. By working together and supporting
      each other, we can build a strong and successful community.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 id="section13">13. Multiple IDs owned by Representatives</h2>
    <p>As a measure to ensure the smooth functioning of our clan, the leader and official co-leaders may have multiple
      IDs in the game. However, to avoid confusion among members, we would like to inform you that the original IDs with
      their respective names and tags are mentioned below in a tabular format:
